Hi! Welcome to my personal GitHub website. I am currently a Junior Data Engineer BI at De Volksbank. I have got a background in Business Informatics during my undergraduate studies at the [Hogeschool Utrecht (HU)](https://www.hu.nl/voltijd-opleidingen/hbo-ict) and one year of graduate studies at the [Utrecht University (UU)](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/business-informatics). Recently, I have majored in the graduate studies of Information Studies: Data Science at the [University of Amsterdam (UVA)](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html). For my full resume, you could go to my [CV](https://rchou97.github.io/cv/) page or to my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/chourichard).

Previously, I worked for [Finaps](https://www.finaps.nl/), a cool scale-up company based in Amsterdam focused on analytics and application development in open source languages and the low-code platform Mendix, Accenture Technology in Utrecht and did an internship at Coolblue.

Interests
======
My interests revolve around:

* Technology
* Stock-trading
* Coding
* Reading
* Running
* Cooking
* Football
* And finally, just learning in general

Why this website?
======
Multiple reasons. Started by increasing the visibility of my profile on the internet. Having numerous channels that relate to my profile on the net could help in this case. Secondly, I always wanted a personal website to showcase the things that I am doing in the past and present. And it is nice to look back on the things that I have done in the past. And finally, I just wanted to work on something and maybe design it to my liking. I am not aiming to make the website super flashy or attract a lot of traffic, but to just add a few things/sections which I find interesting to share on a work/project basis.

If you have any questions and/or remarks, please feel free to reach out to me via mail or LinkedIn!
